Describe this repo


# Directory Structure

- data: contains raw datasets processed for the analysis

- cache: contains intermediate datasets generated while processing/analyzing data

- code: contains scripts written to process and analyze data

- outputs: contains data, tables, and figures 

Useful Tips:

- Use all relative references (as opposed to absolute) so others can clone your repository and run your code

- Github doesn't want to store large datasets so use .gitignore to specify files that you don't want git to track.  We need to coordinate sharing in another platform like google drive.
